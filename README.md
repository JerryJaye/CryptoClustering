# CryptoClustering - Challenge 19

Created on 7 April 2024


The data file is crypto_market_data.csv, and the starter_file to Crypto_Clustering.ipynb. I created
the program in Jupyter Notebook.

I have answered the questions posed by the instruction regarding the optimal 'k' value in both the Kmeans inertia value derived from the scaled data and the PCA data. the value was 4 in each case.

To enhance our understanding, I prepared detailed plots that visually compare the scaled data and PCA results. These plots provide a clear visual representation of the data's clustering patterns.
